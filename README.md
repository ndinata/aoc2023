# advent of code 2023
educational endeavour for me to:
- continue practising using Rust to solve problems, and
- more specifically skill up in writing text parsers

some of the earlier days' answers are inspired by https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/advent-of-code,
from whom I'm grateful to have learned how to use [`nom`](https://github.com/rust-bakery/nom),
and also for the exposure to neat crates like [`rstest`](https://github.com/la10736/rstest).


## how to run
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ndinata/aoc2023.git
$ cd aoc2023

# example: running tests for day 2's solutions (for both part 1 and 2)
$ make test day=02

# example: printing the solution for day 4 part 2
$ make run day=04 part=2
```
